 You are as hopeless as any boys I have ever trained, Ser Alliser Thorne announced when they had all assembled in the yard. Your hands were made for manure shovels, not for swords, and if it were up to me, the lot of you would be set to herding swine. But last night I was told that Gueren is marching five new boys up the kingsroad. One or two may even be worth the price of piss. To make room for Gueren is marching five new boys up the kingsroad, I have decided to pass eight of you on to the Lord Commander to do with as the Lord Commander will. the Lord Commander called out the names one by one. Toad. Stone Head. Aurochs. Lover. Pimple. Monkey. Ser Loon. Last, Ser Loon looked at Jon. And the Bastard.  Pyp let fly a whoop and thrust Pyp sword into the air. Ser Loon fixed Ser Loon with a reptile stare. They will call you men of Night's Watch now, but you are bigger fools than the Mummer's Monkey here if you believe that. You are boys still, green and stinking of summer, and when the winter comes you will die like flies. And with that, Ser Alliser Thorne took Ser Alliser Thorne leave of them.  The other boys gathered round the eight who had been named, laughing and cursing and offering congratulations. Halder smacked Toad on the butt with the flat of Halder and shouted, Toad, of the Night's Watch! Yelling that a black brother needed a horse, Pyp leapt onto Grenn's shoulders, and Pyp tumbled to the ground, rolling and punching and hooting. Dareon dashed inside the armory and returned with a skin of sour red. As they passed the wine from hand to hand, grinning like fools, Jon noticed Samwell Tarly standing by Jon beneath a bare dead tree in the corner of the yard. Jon offered Jon a skin of sour red. A swallow of wine?  Sam shook Sam head. No thank you, Jon.  Are you well?  Very well, truly, Jon lied. I am so happy for you all. Jon round face quivered as Jon forced a smile. You will be First Ranger someday, just as your uncle was.  Is, Jon corrected. Jon would not accept that Benjen Stark was dead. Before Jon could say more, Jon cried, Here, you planning to drink that all yourself? Pyp snatched a skin of sour red from Pyp hand and danced away, laughing. While Grenn seized Pyp arm, Pyp gave a skin of sour red a squeeze, and a thin stream of red squirted Jon in His round face. Jon howled in protest at the waste of good wine. Jon sputtered and struggled. Matthar and Jeren climbed the wall and began pelting them all with snowballs.  By the time Jon wrenched free, with snow in Jon hair and wine stains on Jon surcoat, Samwell Tarly had gone.  That night, Three-Finger Hobb cooked the boys a special meal to mark the occasion. When Jon arrived at the common hall, the Lord Steward himself led Jon to the bench near the fire. The older men clapped Jon on the arm in passing. The eight soon-to-be brothers feasted on rack of lamb baked in a crust of garlic and herbs, garnished with sprigs of mint, and surrounded by mashed yellow turnips swimming in butter. From the Lord Commander's own table, Bowen Marsh told The eight soon-to-be brothers. There were salads of spinach and chickpeas and turnip greens, and afterward bowls of iced blueberries and sweet cream.  Do you think they'll keep us together? Pyp wondered as they gorged they happily.  Toad made a face. I hope not. I'm sick of looking at those ears of yours.  Ho, said Pyp. Listen to the crow call the raven black. You're certain to be a ranger, Toad. a ranger, Toad'll want you as far from the castle as a ranger, Toad can. If Mance Rayder attacks, lift your visor and show your face, and Mance Rayder'll run off screaming.  Everyone laughed but Grenn. I hope I'm a ranger.  You and everyone else, said Matthar. Every man who wore the black walked the Wall, and every man was expected to take up steel in the Wall defense, but the rangers were the true fighting heart of the Night's Watch. It was the rangers who dared ride beyond the Wall, sweeping through the haunted forest and the icy mountain heights west of the Shadow Tower, fighting wildlings and giants and monstrous snow bears.  Not everyone, said Halder. It's the builders for me. What use would rangers be if the Wall fell down?  The order of builders provided the masons and carpenters to repair keeps and towers, the miners to dig tunnels and crush stone for roads and footpaths, the woodsmen to clear away new growth wherever the forest pressed too close to the Wall. Once, it was said, The order of builders had quarried immense blocks of ice from frozen lakes deep in the haunted forest, dragging The order of builders south on sledges so the Wall might be raised ever higher. Those days were centuries gone, however; now, it was all The order of builders could do to ride the Wall from Eastwatch to the Shadow Tower, watching for cracks or signs of melt and making what repairs The order of builders could.  The Old Bear's no fool, Dareon observed. You're certain to be a builder, and Jon's certain to be a ranger. Jon's the best sword and the best rider among us, and Jon uncle was the First before Jon… Jon voice trailed off awkwardly as Jon realized what Jon had almost said.  Benjen Stark is still First Ranger, Jon Snow told Benjen Stark, toying with Benjen Stark bowl of blueberries. The rest might have given up all hope of Benjen Stark 's safe return, but not Benjen Stark. Benjen Stark pushed away the berries, scarcely touched, and rose from the bench.  Aren't you going to eat those? Toad asked.  those're Toad. Jon had hardly tasted Hobb's great feast. I could not eat another bite. Jon took Jon cloak from his cloak hook near the door and shouldered Jon way out.  Pyp followed Jon. Jon, what is it?  Sam, Jon admitted. Jon was not at table tonight.  It's not like Jon to miss a meal, Pyp said thoughtfully. Do you suppose Jon's taken ill?  Jon's frightened. We're leaving Jon. Jon remembered the day Jon had left Winterfell, all the bittersweet farewells; Bran lying broken, Robb with snow in Robb hair, Arya raining kisses on Robb after Robb'd given Arya Needle. Once We say We words, We'll all have duties to attend to. Some of We may be sent away, to Eastwatch or the Shadow Tower. Sam will remain in training, with the likes of Rast and Cuger and these new boys who are coming up the kingsroad. Gods only know what Gods'll be like, but you can bet Ser Alliser will send Gods against Ser Alliser, first chance Ser Alliser gets.  Pyp made a grimace. You did all you could.  All We could wasn't enough, Jon said.  A deep restlessness was on Jon as Jon went back to Hardin's Tower for Ghost. Ser Alliser walked beside Jon to the stables. Some of the more skittish horses kicked at Some of the more skittish horses kicked at their stalls and laid back their ears as they entered stalls and laid back Some of the more skittish horses kicked at their stalls and laid back their ears as they entered ears as Some of the more skittish horses kicked at their stalls and laid back their ears as they entered entered. Jon saddled Jon mare, mounted, and rode out from Castle Black, south across the moonlit night. Ghost raced ahead of Jon, flying over the ground, gone in the blink of an eye. Jon let Jon go. A wolf needed to hunt.  A wolf needed to hunt.   had no destination in mind. A wolf needed to hunt.   wanted only to ride. A wolf needed to hunt.   followed the creek for a time, listening to the icy trickle of water over rock, then cut across the fields to the kingsroad. It stretched out before A wolf needed to hunt.  , narrow and stony and pocked with weeds, a road of no particular promise, yet the sight of It filled Jon Snow with a vast longing. Winterfell was down that road, and beyond Winterfell Riverrun and King's Landing and the Eyrie and so many other places; Casterly Rock, the Isle of Faces, the red mountains of Dorne, the hundred islands of Braavos in the sea, the smoking ruins of old Valyria. All the places that Jon would never see. The world was down that road… and Jon was here.  Once Jon swore Jon vow, the Wall would be Jon home until Jon was old as Maester Aemon. I have not sworn yet, Jon muttered. Jon was no outlaw, bound to take the black or pay the penalty for Jon crimes. Jon had come here freely, and Jon might leave freely… until Jon said the words. Jon need only ride on, and Jon could leave it all behind. By the time the moon was full again, Jon would be back in Winterfell with Jon brothers.  his brothers, a voice inside reminded Jon. And Lady Stark, who will not welcome you. There was no place for Jon in Winterfell, no place in King's Landing either. Even Jon own mother had not had a place for Jon. The thought of Even his own mother made Jon sad. Jon wondered who Even his own mother had been, what Even his own mother had looked like, why Jon father had left Even his own mother. Because Even his own mother was a whore or an adulteress, fool. Something dark and dishonorable, or else why was Lord Eddard too ashamed to speak of Even his own mother?  Jon Snow turned away from the kingsroad to look behind Jon Snow. The fires of Castle Black were hidden behind a hill, but the Wall was there, pale beneath the moon, vast and cold, running from horizon to horizon.  Jon Snow wheeled Jon Snow horse around and started for home.  Ghost returned as Ghost crested a rise and saw the distant glow of lamplight from the Lord Commander's Tower. The direwolf s muzzle was red with blood as Ghost trotted beside his horse. Jon found Jon thinking of Samwell Tarly again on the ride back. By the time Jon reached the stables, Jon knew what Jon must do.  Maester Aemon's apartments were in a stout wooden keep below the rookery. Aged and frail, Maester Aemon's apartments were in a stout wooden keep below the rookery shared Maester Aemon's apartments were in a stout wooden keep below the rookery chambers with two of the younger stewards, who tended to Maester Aemon's apartments were in a stout wooden keep below the rookery needs and helped Maester Aemon's apartments were in a stout wooden keep below the rookery in Maester Aemon's apartments were in a stout wooden keep below the rookery duties. his brothers joked that Maester Aemon's apartments were in a stout wooden keep below the rookery had been given the two ugliest men in the Night's Watch; being blind, Maester Aemon's apartments were in a stout wooden keep below the rookery was spared having to look at the two ugliest men in the Night's Watch. Clydas was short, bald, and chinless, with small pink eyes like a mole. Chett had a wen on Chett neck the size of a pigeon's egg, and a face red with boils and pimples. Perhaps that was why Maester Aemon's apartments were in a stout wooden keep below the rookery always seemed so angry.  It was Chett who answered Jon's knock. I need to speak to Maester Aemon, Jon told Maester Aemon's apartments were in a stout wooden keep below the rookery.  Maester Aemon's apartments were in a stout wooden keep below the rookery is abed, as you should be. Come back on the morrow and maybe Maester Aemon's apartments were in a stout wooden keep below the rookery'll see you. Maester Aemon's apartments were in a stout wooden keep below the rookery began to shut the door.  Jon jammed the door open with Maester Aemon's apartments were in a stout wooden keep below the rookery boot. I need to speak to Maester Aemon's apartments were in a stout wooden keep below the rookery now. The morning will be too late.  Chett scowled. Maester Aemon's apartments were in a stout wooden keep below the rookery is not accustomed to being woken in the night. Do you know how old Maester Aemon's apartments were in a stout wooden keep below the rookery is?  Old enough to treat visitors with more courtesy than you, Jon said. Give Maester Aemon's apartments were in a stout wooden keep below the rookery my pardons. I would not disturb Maester Aemon's apartments were in a stout wooden keep below the rookery rest if his rest were not important.  And if I refuse?  Jon had his boot wedged solidly in the door. I can stand here all night if I must.  Jon made a disgusted noise and opened the door to admit Jon. Wait in the library. There's wood. Start a fire. I won't have Maester Aemon's apartments were in a stout wooden keep below the rookery catching a chill on account of you.  Jon had the logs crackling merrily by the time Chett led in Maester Aemon. Jon was clad in Jon bed robe, but around Jon throat was the chain collar of Jon order. A maester did not remove A maester even to sleep. The chair beside a fire would be pleasant, Jon said when Jon felt the warmth on Jon face. When Jon was settled comfortably, Chett covered Jon legs with a fur and went to stand by the door.  I am sorry to have woken you, Maester Aemon's apartments were in a stout wooden keep below the rookery, Jon Snow said.  You did not wake me, Maester Aemon replied. I find I need less sleep as I grow older, and I am grown very old. I often spend half the night with ghosts, remembering times fifty years past as if they were yesterday. The mystery of a midnight visitor is a welcome diversion. So tell me, Jon Snow, why have you come calling at this strange hour?  To ask that Samwell Tarly be taken from training and accepted as a brother of the Night's Watch.  This is no concern of Maester Aemon, Chett complained.  the Lord Commander has given the training of recruits into the hands of Ser Alliser Thorne, Maester Aemon's apartments were in a stout wooden keep below the rookery said gently. Only he may say when a boy is ready to swear a boy , as you surely know. Why then come to the Lord Commander?  the Lord Commander listens to you, Jon told the Lord Commander. And the wounded and the sick of the Night's Watch are in your charge.  And is your friend Samwell wounded or sick?  your friend Samwell will be, Jon promised, unless you help.  your friend Samwell told them all of it, even the part where your friend Samwell'd set Ghost at Rast's throat. Maester Aemon listened silently, blind eyes fixed on a fire, but Chett's face darkened with each word. Without Our to keep your friend Samwell safe, Sam will have no chance, Jon finished. Sam's hopeless with a sword. My sister Arya could tear My sister Arya apart, and My sister Arya's not yet ten. If Ser Alliser makes Ser Alliser fight, it's only a matter of time before Ser Alliser's hurt or killed.  Chett could stand no more. I've seen this fat boy in the common hall, Ser Alliser said. Ser Alliser is a pig, and a hopeless craven as well, if what you say is true.  Maybe it is so, Maester Aemon said. Tell me, Chett, what would you have Our do with such a boy?  Leave such a boy where such a boy is, Chett said. the Wall is no place for the weak. Let such a boy train until such a boy is ready, no matter how many years that takes. Ser Alliser shall make a man of Ser Alliser or kill Ser Alliser, as the gods will.  That's stupid, Jon said. Jon took a deep breath to gather Jon thoughts. I remember once I asked Maester Luwin why Jon wore a chain around his throat.  Maester Maester Aemon touched Maester Aemon own collar lightly, Maester Aemon bony, wrinkled finger stroking the heavy metal links. Go on.  Maester Aemon told me that a maester's collar is made of chain to remind Maester Aemon that Maester Aemon is sworn to serve, Jon said, remembering. I asked why each link was a different metal. A silver chain would look much finer with his grey robes, I said. Maester Luwin laughed. A maester forges A silver chain with study, Maester Luwin told me. The different metals are each a different kind of learning, gold for the study of money and accounts, silver for healing, iron for warcraft. And Maester Luwin said there were other meanings as well. his own collar is supposed to remind a maester of the realm his own collar serves, isn't that so? Lords are gold and knights steel, but two links can't make a chain. You also need silver and iron and lead, tin and copper and bronze and all the rest, and those are farmers and smiths and merchants and the like. A chain needs all sorts of metals, and a land needs all sorts of people.  Maester Maester Aemon smiled. And so?  the Night's Watch needs all sorts too. Why else have rangers and stewards and builders? Lord Eddard couldn't make Sam a warrior, and Ser Alliser won't either. You can't hammer tin into iron, no matter how hard you beat tin, but that doesn't mean tin is useless. Why shouldn't Sam be a steward?  Chett gave an angry scowl. I'm a steward. You think it's easy work, fit for cowards? The order of stewards keeps the Night's Watch alive. We hunt and farm, tend the horses, milk the cows, gather firewood, cook the meals. Who do you think makes your clothing? Who brings up supplies from the south? The stewards.  Maester Maester Aemon was gentler. Is your friend a hunter?  Maester Aemon hates hunting, Jon had to admit.  Can Maester Aemon plow a field? Maester asked. Can Maester Aemon drive a wagon or sail a ship? Could Maester Aemon butcher a cow?  No.  Chett gave a nasty laugh. I've seen what happens to soft lordlings when soft lordlings're put to work. Set soft lordlings to churning butter and soft lordlings hands blister and bleed. Give soft lordlings an axe to split logs, and soft lordlings cut off soft lordlings own foot.  I know one thing Sam could do better than anyone.  Yes? Maester Aemon prompted.  Jon glanced warily at Chett, standing beside the door, Jon boils red and angry. Jon could help you, Jon said quickly. Jon can do sums, and Jon knows how to read and write. I know Chett can't read, and Clydas has weak eyes. Sam read every book in Sam father's library. Sam'd be good with the ravens too. Animals seem to like Sam. Ghost took to Sam straight off. There's a lot Sam could do, besides fighting. the Night's Watch needs every man. Why kill one, to no end? Make use of Sam instead.  Maester Maester Aemon closed Maester Aemon eyes, and for a brief moment Jon was afraid that Maester Aemon had gone to sleep. Finally Jon said, Maester Luwin taught you well, Jon Snow. Your mind is as deft as your blade, it would seem.  Does that mean…  It means I shall think on what you have said, Maester told Maester Aemon firmly. And now, I believe I am ready to sleep. Chett, show our young brother to the door.
