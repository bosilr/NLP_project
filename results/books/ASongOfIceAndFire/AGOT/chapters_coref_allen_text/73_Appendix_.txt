Harren the Black, King of the Isles's grandfather, King Harwyn Hardhand, had taken the Trident from Arrec the Storm King, whose ancestors had conquered all the way to the Neck three hundred years earlier, slaying the last of the old River Kings. A vain and bloody tyrant, Harren the Black, King of the Isles was little loved by those Harren the Black, King of the Isles ruled, and many of the river lords deserted Harren the Black, King of the Isles to join Aegon's army.First among those was Edmyn Tully of Riverrun. When Harren and Harren's line perished in the burning of Harrenhal, Aegon rewarded House Tully by raising Edmyn Tully of Riverrun to dominion over the lands of the Trident and requiring the other river lords to swear Edmyn Tully of Riverrun fealty. The House Tully sigil is a leaping trout, silver, on a field of rippling blue and red.

HOUSE GREYJOY  The Greyjoys of Pyke claim descent from the Grey King of the Age of Heroes. Legend says the Grey King of the Age of Heroes ruled not only the western isles but the sea the sea itself, and took a mermaid to wife.For thousands of years, raiders from the Iron Islands—called ironmen by those raiders from the Iron Islands—called ironmen by those they plundered plundered—were the terrors of the seas, sailing as far as the Port of Ibben and the Summer Isles. raiders from the Iron Islands—called ironmen by those they plundered prided raiders from the Iron Islands—called ironmen by those they plundered on raiders from the Iron Islands—called ironmen by those they plundered's fierceness in battle and raiders from the Iron Islands—called ironmen by those they plundered's sacred freedoms. Each island had Each island's own salt king and rock king.The High King of the Isles was chosen from among their number, until King Urron made the throne hereditary by murdering the other kings when the other kings assembled for a choosing. King Urron's own line was extinguished a thousand years later when the Andals swept over the Isles. The Greyjoys, like other island lords, intermarried with the Andals.The Iron Kings extended The Iron Kings's rule far beyond the isles themselves, carving kingdoms out of the mainland with fire and sword. King Qhored could truthfully boast that King Qhored's writ ran wherever men can smell salt water or hear the crash of waves. In later centuries, King Qhored's descendants lost the Arbor, Oldtown, Bear Island, and much of the western shore.Still, come the Wars of Conquest, King Harren the Black ruled all the lands between the mountains, from the Neck to the Blackwater Rush. When King Harren the Black and King Harren the Black's sons perished in the fall of Harrenhal, Aegon Targaryen granted the riverlands to House Tully, and allowed the surviving lords of the Iron Islands to revive the surviving lords of the Iron Islands's ancient custom and choose who should have the primacy among the surviving lords of the Iron Islands. the surviving lords of the Iron Islands chose Lord Vickon Greyjoy of Pyke.The Greyjoy sigil is a golden kraken upon a black field. The Greyjoy sigil's words are We Do Not Sow. BALON GREYJOY, Lord of the Iron Islands, King of Salt and Rock, Son of the Sea Wind, Lord Reaper of Pyke.—his wife, LADY ALANNYS, of House Harlaw,  —their children:    —{RODRIK}, —their's eldest son, slain at Seagard during Greyjoy's Rebellion,  —{MARON}, —their's second son, slain on the walls of Pyke during Greyjoy's Rebellion,  —ASHA, —their's daughter, captain of the Black Wind,  —THEON, —their's sole surviving son, heir to Pyke, a ward of Lord Eddard Stark,    —his brothers:    —EURON, called Crow's Eye, captain of the Silence, an outlaw, pirate, and raider,  —VICTARION, Lord Captain of the Iron Fleet,  —AERON, called Damphair, a priest of the Drowned God,      Lesser houses sworn to Pyke include Harlaw, Stonehouse, Merlyn, Sunderly, Botley, Tawney, Wynch, Goodbrother. HOUSE MARTELL  Nymeria, the warrior queen of the Rhoyne, brought Nymeria, the warrior queen of the Rhoyne ten thousand ships to land in Dorne, the southernmost of the Seven Kingdoms, and took Lord Mors Martell to husband. With Nymeria, the warrior queen of the Rhoyne's help, Lord Mors Martell vanquished Lord Mors Martell's rivals to rule Dorne, the southernmost of the Seven Kingdoms.The Rhoynar influence remains strong. Thus Dornish rulers style Dornish rulers Prince rather than King. Under Dornish law, lands and titles pass to the eldest child, not the eldest male.Dorne, alone of the Seven Kingdoms, was never conquered by Aegon the Dragon. Dorne, alone of the Seven Kingdoms was not permanently joined to the realm until two hundred years later, and then by marriage and treaty, not the sword. Peaceable King Daeron II succeeded where the warriors had failed by wedding the Dornish princess Myriah and giving Peaceable King Daeron II's own sister in marriage to the reigning Prince of Dorne, alone of the Seven Kingdoms.The Martell banner is a red sun pierced by a golden spear. Their words are Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken.

Aegon the Dragon's ancestors escaped the Doom of the ancient Freehold of Valyria and the chaos and slaughter that followed to settle on Dragonstone, a rocky island in the narrow sea. It was from there that the dragon and the dragon's sisters sailed to conquer the Seven Kingdoms.To preserve the blood royal and keep the blood pure, House Targaryen has often followed the Valyrian custom of wedding brother to sister. Aegon himself took both Aegon himself's sisters to wife, and fathered sons on each. The Targaryen banner is a three-headed dragon, red on black, the three heads representing both his sistersboth his sisters.The Targaryen words are Fire and Blood.
