  You are as hopeless as any boys I have ever trained, I announced when  You had all assembled in the yard.  You's hands were made for manure shovels, not for swords, and if it were up to I,  You would be set to herding swine. But last night I was told that Gueren is marching five new boys up the kingsroad. One or two may even be worth the price of piss. To make room for five new boys, I have decided to pass eight of you on to the Lord Commander to do with as the Lord Commander will. I called out the names one by one. Toad. Stone Head. Aurochs. Lover. Pimple.Monkey. Ser Loon. Last, Ser Loon. looked at Jon. And the Bastard. Pyp let fly a whoop and thrust Pyp's sword into the air. Ser Loon. fixed Pyp with a reptile stare. They will call Pyp men of Night's Watch now, but Pyp are bigger fools than the Mummer's Monkey here if Pyp believe are. Pyp are boys still, green and stinking of summer, and when the winter comes Pyp will die like flies. And with that, Ser Loon. took Ser Loon.'s leave of Pyp. The other boys gathered round Pyp, laughing and cursing and offering congratulations. Halder smacked Toad on the butt with the flat of Halder's sword and shouted, Toad, of Night's Watch!Yelling that a black brother needed a horse, Pyp leapt onto Grenn's shoulders, and they tumbled to the ground, rolling and punching and hooting. Dareon dashed inside the armory and returned with a skin of sour red. As they passed the wine from hand to hand, grinning like fools, Dareon noticed Samwell Tarly standing by Samwell Tarly beneath a bare dead tree in the corner of the yard. Dareon offered Samwell Tarly a skin of sour red. A swallow of wine? Samwell Tarly shook Samwell Tarly's head. No thank Dareon, Dareon. Are Samwell Tarly well? Very well, truly, Samwell Tarly lied. Samwell Tarly am so happy for you all. Samwell Tarly's round face quivered as Samwell Tarly forced a smile.You will be First Ranger someday, just as You's uncle was. Is, Jon corrected. Jon would not accept that your uncle was dead. Before Jon could say more, Haider cried, Here, Jon planning to drink that all Jon? Pyp snatched the skin from Jon's hand and danced away, laughing. While Grenn seized Jon's arm, Pyp gave the skin a squeeze, and a thin stream of red squirted Jon in the face. Haider howled in protest at the waste of good wine. Jon sputtered and struggled. Matthar and Jeren climbed the wall and began pelting them all with snowballs. By the time Jon wrenched free, with snow in Jon's hair and wine stains on Jon's surcoat, Samwell Tarly had gone. That night, Three-Finger Hobb cooked the boys a special meal to mark the occasion.When Jon arrived at the common hall, the Lord Steward the Lord Steward himself led Jon to the bench near the fire. The older men clapped Jon on the arm in passing. The eight soon-to-be brothers feasted on rack of lamb baked in a crust of garlic and herbs, garnished with sprigs of mint, and surrounded by mashed yellow turnips swimming in butter. From the Lord Commander's own table, Bowen Marsh told The eight soon-to-be brothers. There were salads of spinach and chickpeas and turnip greens, and afterward bowls of iced blueberries and sweet cream. Do you think they'll keep The eight soon-to-be brothers together? Pyp wondered as The eight soon-to-be brothers gorged The eight soon-to-be brothers happily. Toad made a face. Toad hope not. Toad'm sick of looking at those ears of Pyp. Ho, said Pyp.Listen to the crow call the raven black. You're certain to be a ranger, You. They'll want You as far from the castle as They can. If Mance Rayder attacks, lift You's visor and show You's face, and Mance Rayder'll run off screaming. Everyone laughed but Grenn. Grenn hope Grenn'm a ranger. You and everyone else, said Matthar. Every man who wore the black walked the Wall, and every man was expected to take up steel in the Wall's defense, but the rangers were the true fighting heart of the Night's Watch. It was the rangers who dared ride beyond the Wall, sweeping through the haunted forest and the icy mountain heights west of the Shadow Tower, fighting wildlings and giants and monstrous snow bears. Not everyone, said Halder. It's the builders for Halder.What use would rangers be if the Wall fell down? The order of builders provided the masons and carpenters to repair keeps and towers, the miners to dig tunnels and crush stone for roads and footpaths, the woodsmen to clear away new growth wherever the forest pressed too close to the Wall. Once, it was said, they had quarried immense blocks of ice from frozen lakes deep in the haunted forest, dragging immense blocks of ice south on sledges so the Wall might be raised ever higher. Those days were centuries gone, however; now, it was all they could do to ride the Wall from Eastwatch to the Shadow Tower, watching for cracks or signs of melt and making what repairs they could. The Old Bear's no fool, Dareon observed. You're certain to be a builder, and Jon's certain to be a ranger. Jon's the best sword and the best rider among us, and Jon's uncle was the First before Jon… Dareon's voice trailed off awkwardly as Dareon realized what Dareon had almost said. his uncle is still First Ranger, Jon told Dareon, toying with Jon's bowl of blueberries. The rest might have given up all hope of his uncle's safe return, but not his uncle. Jon pushed away his bowl of blueberries, and rose from the bench. Aren't Jon going to eat his bowl of blueberries?Toad asked. They're yours. yours had hardly tasted Hobb's great feast. yours could not eat another bite. yours took yours's cloak from his cloak's hook near the door and shouldered yours's way out. Pyp followed yours. yours, what is it? Sam, yours admitted. yours was not at table tonight. It's not like yours to miss a meal, Pyp said thoughtfully. Do yours suppose yours's taken ill?He's frightened. We're leaving He. He remembered the day He had left Winterfell, all the bittersweet farewells; Bran lying broken, Robb with snow in Robb with snow in his hair's hair, Arya raining kisses on Robb with snow in his hair after Robb with snow in his hair'd given Arya Needle. Once We say We's words, We'll all have duties to attend to. Some of We may be sent away, to Eastwatch or the Shadow Tower. He will remain in training, with the likes of Rast and Cuger and these new boys who are coming up the kingsroad. Gods only know what these new boys who are coming up the kingsroad'll be like, but you can bet Ser Alliser will send these new boys who are coming up the kingsroad against He, first chance Ser Alliser gets. Pyp made a grimace. He did all He could. All We could wasn't enough, He said. A deep restlessness was on He as He went back to Hardin's Tower for Ghost.The direwolf walked beside him to the stables. Some of the more skittish horses kicked at Some of the more skittish horses's stalls and laid back Some of the more skittish horses's ears as Some of the more skittish horses entered. him saddled him's mare, mounted, and rode out from Castle Black, south across the moonlit night. The direwolf raced ahead of him, flying over the ground, gone in the blink of an eye. him let The direwolf go. A wolf needed to hunt. him had no destination in mind. him wanted only to ride. him followed the creek for a time, listening to the icy trickle of water over rock, then cut across the fields to the kingsroad. the kingsroad stretched out before him, narrow and stony and pocked with weeds, a road of no particular promise, yet the sight of the kingsroad filled him with a vast longing. Winterfell was down the kingsroad, and beyond the kingsroad Riverrun and King's Landing and the Eyrie and so many other places; Casterly Rock, the Isle of Faces, the red mountains of Dorne, the hundred islands of Braavos in the sea, the smoking ruins of old Valyria.All the places that Jon would never see. The world was down that road… and Jon was here. Once Jon swore Jon's vow, the Wall would be Jon's home until Jon was old as Maester Aemon. Jon have not sworn yet, Jon muttered. Jon was no outlaw, bound to take the black or pay the penalty for Jon's crimes. Jon had come here freely, and Jon might leave freely… until Jon said the words. Jon need only ride on, and Jon could leave it all behind. By the time the moon was full again, Jon would be back in Winterfell with Jon's brothers. his brothers, a voice inside reminded Jon. And Lady Stark, who will not welcome Jon.There was no place for him in Winterfell, no place in King's Landing either. Even him's own mother had not had a place for him. The thought of his own mother made him sad. him wondered who his own mother had been, what his own mother had looked like, why him's father had left his own mother. Because his own mother was a whore or an adulteress, fool. Something dark and dishonorable, or else why was his father too ashamed to speak of his own mother? him turned away from the kingsroad to look behind him. The fires of Castle Black were hidden behind a hill, but the Wall was there, pale beneath the moon, vast and cold, running from horizon to horizon. him wheeled him's horse around and started for home. Ghost returned as him crested a rise and saw the distant glow of lamplight from the Lord Commander's Tower.The direwolf s muzzle was red with blood as The direwolf s trotted beside the horse. The direwolf s found The direwolf s thinking of Samwell Tarly again on the ride back. By the time The direwolf s reached the stables, The direwolf s knew what The direwolf s must do. Maester Aemon's apartments were in a stout wooden keep below the rookery. Aged and frail, Maester Aemon's shared Maester Aemon's apartments with two of the younger stewards, who tended to Maester Aemon's's needs and helped Maester Aemon's in Maester Aemon's's duties. two of the younger stewards, who tended to his needs and helped him in his duties joked that Maester Aemon's had been given the two ugliest men in the Night's Watch; being blind, Maester Aemon's was spared having to look at the two ugliest men in the Night's Watch. Clydas was short, bald, and chinless, with small pink eyes like a mole. Chett had a wen on Chett's neck the size of a pigeon's egg, and a face red with boils and pimples. Perhaps that was why Chett always seemed so angry. It was Chett who answered The direwolf s's knock.I need to speak to Maester Aemon, I told him. Maester Aemon is abed, as I should be. Come back on the morrow and maybe Maester Aemon'll see I. him began to shut the door. I jammed the door open with I's boot. I need to speak to Maester Aemon now. The morning will be too late. him scowled. Maester Aemon is not accustomed to being woken in the night. Do him know how old Maester Aemon is?Old enough to treat visitors with more courtesy than you, Jon said. Give him Jon's pardons. Jon would not disturb him's rest if it were not important. And if you refuse? Jon had Jon's boot wedged solidly in the door. Jon can stand here all night if Jon must. you made a disgusted noise and opened the door to admit Jon. Wait in the library. There's wood. Start a fire.I won't have the maester catching a chill on account of you. Jon had the logs crackling merrily by the time Chett led in the maester. the maester was clad in the maester's bed robe, but around the maester's throat was the chain collar of the maester's order. A maester did not remove the chain collar of his order even to sleep. The chair beside the fire would be pleasant, the maester said when the maester felt the warmth on the maester's face. When the maester was settled comfortably, Chett covered the maester's legs with a fur and went to stand by the door. Jon am sorry to have woken the maester, the maester, Jon said. Jon did not wake the maester, the maester replied. the maester find the maester need less sleep as the maester grow older, and the maester am grown very old. the maester often spend half the night with ghosts, remembering times fifty years past as if times fifty years past were yesterday.The mystery of a midnight visitor is a welcome diversion. So tell me, Jon Snow, why have Jon Snow come calling at this strange hour? To ask that Samwell Tarly be taken from training and accepted as a brother of the Night's Watch. This is no concern of Maester Aemon, Chett complained. Our Lord Commander has given the training of recruits into the hands of Ser Alliser Thorne, Maester Aemon said gently. Ser Alliser Thorne may say when a boy is ready to swear a boy's vow, as Chett surely know. Why then come to me? Our Lord Commander listens to Maester Aemon, Jon Snow told Chett. And the wounded and the sick of the Night's Watch are in Maester Aemon's charge. And is Samwell Tarly wounded or sick?He will be, Jon promised, unless you help. Jon told you all of it, even the part where Jon'd set Ghost at Rast's throat. Maester Aemon listened silently, blind eyes fixed on the fire, but Chett's face darkened with each word. Without you to keep He safe, He will have no chance, Jon finished. He's hopeless with a sword. Jon's sister Arya could tear He apart, and My sister Arya's not yet ten. If Ser Alliser makes He fight, it's only a matter of time before He's hurt or killed. Chett's could stand no more. Chett's've seen He in the common hall, Chett's said. He is a pig, and a hopeless craven as well, if what Jon say is true.Maybe it is so, Maester Aemon said. Tell Maester Aemon, Chett, what would Chett have us do with such a boy? Leave such a boy where such a boy is, Chett said. The Wall is no place for the weak. Let such a boy train until such a boy is ready, no matter how many years train takes. Ser Alliser shall make a man of such a boy or kill such a boy, as the gods will. That's stupid, Jon said. Jon took a deep breath to gather Jon's thoughts. Jon remember once Jon asked Maester Luwin why Maester Luwin wore a chain around Maester Luwin's throat. Maester Aemon touched Maester Aemon's own collar lightly, Maester Aemon's bony, wrinkled finger stroking the heavy metal links.Go on. He told me that a maester's collar is made of chain to remind a maester's that a maester's is sworn to serve, me said, remembering. me asked why each link was a different metal. A silver chain would look much finer with a maester's's grey robes, me said. He laughed. A maester forges A maester's chain with study, He told me. The different metals are each a different kind of learning, gold for the study of money and accounts, silver for healing, iron for warcraft. And He said there were other meanings as well. a maester's collar is supposed to remind a maester of the realm a maester serves, isn't supposed so? Lords are gold and knights steel, but two links can't make a chain.You also need silver and iron and lead, tin and copper and bronze and all the rest, and silver and iron and lead, tin and copper and bronze and all the rest are farmers and smiths and merchants and the like. A chain needs all sorts of metals, and a land needs all sorts of people. Maester Aemon smiled. And so? The Night's Watch needs all sorts too. Why else have rangers and stewards and builders? Lord Randyll couldn't make Sam a warrior, and Ser Alliser won't either. You can't hammer tin into iron, no matter how hard you beat tin, but that doesn't mean tin is useless. Why shouldn't Sam be a steward? Sam gave an angry scowl.I'm a steward. I think it's easy work, fit for cowards? The order of stewards keeps the Watch alive. The order of stewards hunt and farm, tend the horses, milk the cows, gather firewood, cook the meals. Who do I think makes I's clothing? Who brings up supplies from the south? The order of stewards Maester Aemon was gentler. Is I's friend a hunter? your friend hates hunting, I had to admit.Can he plow a field? the maester asked. Can he drive a wagon or sail a ship? Could he butcher a cow? No. Chett gave a nasty laugh. Chett've seen what happens to soft lordlings when soft lordlings're put to work. Set soft lordlings to churning butter and soft lordlings's hands blister and bleed. Give soft lordlings an axe to split logs, and soft lordlings cut off soft lordlings's own foot. Chett know one thing he could do better than anyone.Yes? Maester Aemon prompted. Jon glanced warily at Chett, standing beside the door, Chett, standing beside the door, his boils red and angry's boils red and angry. Chett, standing beside the door, his boils red and angry could help Maester Aemon, Jon said quickly. Chett, standing beside the door, his boils red and angry can do sums, and Chett, standing beside the door, his boils red and angry knows how to read and write. Jon know Chett, standing beside the door, his boils red and angry can't read, and Clydas has weak eyes. Sam read every book in Sam's father's library. Sam'd be good with the ravens too. Animals seem to like Sam. Ghost took to Sam straight off.There's a lot he could do, besides fighting. The Night's Watch needs every man. Why kill one, to no end? Make use of he instead. Maester Aemon closed Maester Aemon's eyes, and for a brief moment Jon was afraid that Maester Aemon had gone to sleep. Finally Maester Aemon said, Maester Luwin taught Jon well, Jon. Jon's mind is as deft as Jon's blade, it would seem. Does is mean…  is means Maester Aemon shall think on what Jon have said, Maester Aemon told Jon firmly. And now, Maester Aemon believe Maester Aemon am ready to sleep. Chett, show Jon to the door.
